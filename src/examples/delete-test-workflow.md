## Test Workflow

### Phase 1: Basic Functionality Tests

#### Test 1.1: Single Bookmark Deletion
```javascript
// Test individual bookmark deletion
chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
  action: 'deleteBookmark',
  tweetId: 'TWEET_ID_HERE'
}).then(response => {
  console.log('Delete result:', response);
});
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Bookmark removed from local database
- ✅ API call to X.com succeeds
- ✅ Success notification displayed
- ✅ UI updated (bookmark card removed)

#### Test 1.2: Bulk Bookmark Deletion
```javascript
// Test bulk deletion
chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
  action: 'deleteBulkBookmarks',
  tweetIds: ['TWEET_ID_1', 'TWEET_ID_2', 'TWEET_ID_3'],
  options: {
    batchSize: 2,
    delayBetweenBatches: 1000,
    deleteFromApi: true
  }
}).then(response => {
  console.log('Bulk delete result:', response);
});
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All bookmarks removed from local database
- ✅ Batched API calls with proper delays
- ✅ Progress updates during operation
- ✅ Summary of successful/failed deletions

### Phase 2: Selection Mode Tests

#### Test 2.1: Selection Mode Toggle
1. Open bookmark grid
2. Click "Select" button
3. Verify selection mode is active
4. Click individual bookmarks to select/deselect
5. Use "Select All" and "Select None" buttons
6. Click "Cancel" to exit selection mode

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Selection mode UI appears/disappears correctly
- ✅ Checkboxes appear on bookmark cards
- ✅ Selection toolbar shows at bottom
- ✅ Selection count updates correctly

#### Test 2.2: Bulk Selection and Deletion
1. Enter selection mode
2. Select multiple bookmarks
3. Click "Delete Selected"
4. Confirm deletion in dialog
5. Monitor progress indicator
6. Verify results

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Progress modal appears during deletion
- ✅ Selected bookmarks are removed from UI
- ✅ Success notification shows summary
- ✅ Selection mode exits automatically

### Phase 3: Edge Case Tests

#### Test 3.1: Already Deleted Bookmarks
1. Delete a bookmark manually on X.com
2. Try to delete the same bookmark via extension
3. Verify graceful handling

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Local bookmark removed
- ✅ API returns 404, treated as success
- ✅ Notification indicates "already deleted"

#### Test 3.2: Network Errors
1. Disconnect internet
2. Try to delete bookmarks
3. Reconnect and verify state

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Local deletion succeeds
- ✅ API deletion fails gracefully
- ✅ User notified of partial success
- ✅ No data corruption

#### Test 3.3: Rate Limiting
1. Delete many bookmarks rapidly
2. Monitor for rate limit handling
3. Verify automatic retry logic

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Batch processing prevents most rate limits
- ✅ If rate limited, delays are extended
- ✅ Operation continues after delay
- ✅ User sees progress updates

#### Test 3.4: Authentication Issues
1. Clear X.com cookies
2. Try to delete bookmarks
3. Verify error handling

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ CSRF token error detected
- ✅ User notified of authentication issue
- ✅ Local deletion may still succeed

### Phase 4: Performance Tests

#### Test 4.1: Large Bulk Operations
1. Select 100+ bookmarks
2. Delete in bulk
3. Monitor performance and memory usage

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Batched processing prevents browser freeze
- ✅ Progress updates remain responsive
- ✅ Memory usage stays reasonable
- ✅ UI remains interactive

#### Test 4.2: Database Performance
1. Test deletion with large bookmark collections
2. Monitor database operation times
3. Verify index cleanup performance

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Database operations complete in reasonable time
- ✅ Search index cleanup is efficient
- ✅ Tag usage updates are fast

### Phase 5: Integration Tests

#### Test 5.1: Grid Overlay Integration
1. Test delete functionality within existing grid overlay
2. Verify compatibility with existing features
3. Test search and filter interactions during selection mode

#### Test 5.2: Content Script Integration
1. Test bookmark interception still works
2. Verify delete functionality on X.com pages
3. Test notification system integration

#### Test 5.3: Service Worker Communication
1. Test message passing between components
2. Verify progress updates reach all UI components
3. Test error propagation
